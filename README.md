# techdegree-project-2 : List Pagination and Filtering

This project uses unobtrusive JavaScript to add pagination links to a 
long list of students, displaying only 10 students per page. This
will work for a list of any length.  

A search feature is added to allow users to find full or partial
matches to their search. The search button can be activated with a click
or by pressing the enter/return key. The pagination links are updated 
based on the search results. 

If the user's search does not match any names in the list, a "No Results" 
message will appear. If the user does not type anything into the input
field, and clicks search or presses the enter key, the entire list will 
be displayed.
